We treated love like a sport the final blow hit so low I'm still on the ground. I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall. Shattered in pieces curled on the floor. Supernatural love conqueres. Remember we used to touch the sky. And lightning don't strike. The same place twice. When you and I Said goodbye I felt the angels cry. Cause true loves a gift. But we let it drift In the storm. Every night I feel the angels cry. Come on babe can our love be revived. Bring it back and we gon' make it right. I'm on the edge just trying to survive. As the angels cry. Limitless omnipresent kind of love Couldn't have guessed it, would just stop And disappear, in a world where Here I am Walking on this narrow road. Wobbling but won't let go. Waiting for a glimpse of the suns glow. I know I can stand just pull me back up. Like there aint a hurricane its just us. I'm willing to live and die for our love. Baby we can get back that shine. And lightning don't strike. The same place twice. When you and I Said goodbye I felt the angels cry. Cause true loves a gift. But we let it drift In the storm. Every night I feel the angels cry. Come on babe can our love be revived. Bring it back and we gon' make it right. I'm on the edge just trying to survive. As the angels cry. Baby I'm missin' you Don't allow love to lose We gotta ride it through I'm reaching for you Baby I'm missin' you Don't allow love to lose We gotta ride it through I'm reaching for you And lightning don't strike. The same place twice. When you and I Said goodbye I felt the angels cry. Cause true loves a gift. But we let it drift In the storm. Every night I feel the angels cry."

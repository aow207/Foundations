Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a plain or fancy tube pan with an 11- to 12-cup capacity and dust it lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs.
                                                                            Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat the butter to soften it a bit. Add the sugar and beat for 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs individually,  scraping the bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula to keep mixture smooth. On lowest speed, alternately add the dry ingredients in three additions and the milk in two additions, scraping the bowl with the rubber spatula as necessary and beating only until incorporated after each addition. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Stir in lemon zest. Turn the batter into prepared pan. Level top by rotating pan briskly back and forth.
                                                                            Bake for 1 hour and 5 to 10 minutes, until a cake tester comes out dry.
                                                                            Let cake stand in the pan for about 5 minutes and then cover with a rack and invert. Place over a large piece of aluminum foil or wax paper.
                                    For the glaze:                                        The glaze should be used immediately after it is mixed: Stir the lemon juice and sugar together and brush all over the hot cake until absorbed.
                                                                            Let cake cool completely. Use two wide metal pancake turners or a cookie sheet to transfer it to a cake plate. Do not cut for at least several hours.
                                    Variations:                                        I have made this with 1/2 cup Key lime juice in the glaze in place of the 1/3 cup lemon juice and it is divine.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, adding 1–2 tablespoons of the flour if the mixture curdles.
                                                                            In a separate bowl, combine the flour and ground almonds. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until a thick batter forms, then scoop half the mixture into a separate bowl.
                                                                            Add the lemon juice, lemon zest and a little yellow food coloring to one half of the batter, and do the same to the other half with the lime juice, lime zest and green food coloring, mixing until fully combined.
                                                                            Spread the lemon mixture into one half of the tin and the lime mixture into the other half, with the parchment dividing them, and bake for 20–25 minutes or until risen and golden. Allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
                                                                            Use a serrated knife to trim the edges off the cooled sponges. Carefully cut the sides that have colored in the oven, as they can look off-putting if used in the Battenberg. Measure the height of the baked sponge with a ruler and slice the cake into strips the same width as the height, forming a square cross section. Mine are usually 2x2cm (3/4x3/4 inches). This will create perfect squares that stack properly on top of one another.
                                                                            Gently warm the lime marmalade in a small saucepan to loosen it and make it easier to spread, then pass it through a sieve. Stick one lemon strip of cake and one lime strip together using some of the lime marmalade, then stack the alternate color on top of the bottom layer to create the checkerboard effect with the four strips.
                                                                            Lightly dust the worktop with confectioners' sugar, then roll out the marzipan into a large rectangle, trimming the edges so the rectangle is approximately 18x20cm (7x8-inches). Brush the top and sides of the assembled cake with the remaining marmalade, then place top-side down on to the marzipan along the short edge. Brush the face-up side of the cake with more marmalade before tightly rolling it up in the marzipan until it is covered. Press in the final section of marzipan or trim if it looks too long.
                                                                            Trim the ends of the cake using a serrated knife and transfer the Battenberg to a plate or cake stand. The cake will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container.",HarperCollinsHarperCollinsCakeLemonLimeDessertBakeLemon JuiceLime JuiceAlmond

Line an 8x8"" baking pan, preferably metal, with overlapping sheets of parchment paper, leaving at least 4"" overhang on each side. Pulse flour, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, and salt in a food processor a few times to combine. Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are pea-size. Add egg yolks and pulse just until dough comes together in small clumps. (Shortbread can also be made by hand: Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl, then work in the butter with your fingers before mixing in the egg yolks with a sturdy spoon.)
                                                                            Transfer dough to prepared pan (you may find it easier to form the dough into a ball first, instead of working with clumps—entirely up to you!) and press into an even layer. If dough is sticky, use a piece of plastic wrap between your hand and the dough. Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this helps it stay flat as it bakes). Bake shortbread until edges and top are golden brown, 24–28 minutes. Let cool.
                                    Candied grapefruit zest:                                        While the shortbread is baking, use a sharp knife to remove zest from grapefruit in 2""–3"" wide strips (it’s okay to leave some white pith attached). Slice strips very thinly lengthwise; save fruit for another use. Combine zest and 2 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Drain immediately. Combine zest with 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup water in the same saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zest is translucent and softened, 15–20 minutes. Drain, discarding syrup, and toss zest in a small bowl with remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Set aside until ready to use.
                                    Curd and assembly:                                        Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Vigorously whisk eggs, egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cornstarch in a large saucepan until smooth and sugar is mostly dissolved. Whisk in grapefruit zest and juice, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla. Set saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly and making sure to get into the corners of the pan, until curd begins to bubble slightly around the edges and thickens, about 5 minutes. Simmer very gently, still whisking, 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Whisk salt into curd, followed by butter a piece at a time, whisking to fully incorporate after each addition. Scrape curd into pan with shortbread and smooth over crust. Top with some of the candied grapefruit zest (you probably won’t need all of it; snack on any left over!).

Seal bag and whack beans with a rolling pin to split the skins and soften the insides without completely pulverizing the flesh. Place in bowl with reserved dressing. Toss, massaging with your hands to break beans down further and coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.
